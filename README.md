# Corpus of markdown files
This repository aims to contain a large collection of Markdown files. Any
flavour, style, language, or extensions are accepted. The goal is to be able to
test new parsers, perform research for new formats, etc.

Files should be named in a way that makes them possible to distinguish. Since
the repository doesn't currently have representatives for each possible
combination, rules are hard to define. What follows is the current list, to be
expanded as seen fit by future contributions:

- GitHub flavoured markdown should end in `.gh.md`
- Files with YAML frontmatter should contain `.yml.` somewhere in the name
