# Corpus of markdown files
This repository aims to contain a large collection of Markdown files. Any
flavour, style, language, or extensions are accepted. The goal is to be able to
test new parsers, perform research for new formats, etc.

Files should be named in a way that makes them possible to distinguish. Since
the repository doesn't currently have representatives for each possible
combination, rules are hard to define. What follows is the current list, to be
expanded as seen fit by future contributions:

- GitHub flavoured markdown should end in `.gh.md`
- Files with YAML frontmatter should contain `.yml.` somewhere in the name

In general files could be named anything, with a list of identifying features
as the extension name. The flavour should be the last identifier before the
`.md` proper extension.

##  Contributing
To contribute please make sure you are actually allowed to share the contents
of the markdown file. If you don't, but still wish to share the file you can try
to replace any words not significant for the parser in use with lipsum. Just
make sure to properly retain the original structure.
